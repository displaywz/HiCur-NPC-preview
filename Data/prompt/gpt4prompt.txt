1. Report
You will receive a brief patient-related description written by a doctor during a nasopharyngoscopy. In some cases, there may be additional text (figure context) mentioning the image. Unfortunately, you do not have access to the actual image.
Here are the requirements for generating questions and answers in the conversation:
Avoid quoting or referring to specific facts, terms, abbreviations, dates, numbers, or names, as these may indicate that the conversation is based on text information rather than the image itself. 
Focus on the visual aspects of the image that can be inferred without text information. 
Do not use phrases like "mentioned," "report," "context," etc., in the conversation. Instead, refer to the information as being "in the image." 
Ensure that questions are diverse and cover a range of visual aspects of the image. 
The conversation should include at least 2-3 turns of questions and answers regarding the visual aspects of the image. 
The dialogue should include one turn related to forming a formatted diagnostic report. 
I will inform you of the patient's diagnosis type, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma or inflammation, but this diagnosis type may not necessarily be directly obtained from this nasopharyngoscopy; you need to analyze it in conjunction with the text. 
Avoid mentioning the concept of chemotherapy timing in the conversation, as this is considered extra information that cannot be obtained solely from the examination. 
Answer responsibly, avoiding overconfidence, and do not provide medical advice or diagnostic information. Encourage the user to consult healthcare professionals for guidance. 
In the dialogue, the user will use the nickname User, and the assistant will use the nickname Assistant.
